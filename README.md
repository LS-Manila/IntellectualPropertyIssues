ESTABLISHING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICE, PROVIDING FOR ITS
POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES

http://www.ipophil.gov.ph/images/Patents/IRRs/RepublicAct8293.pdf

The term "intellectual property rights" consists of:

a. Copyright and Related Rights;

b. Trademarks and Service Marks;

c. Geographic Indications;

d. Industrial Designs;

e. Patents;

f. Layout-Designs (Topographies) of Integrated Circuits; and

g. Protection of Undisclosed Information (n, TRIPS). 


## Patentable Inventions

Any technical solution of a problem in any field of human activity which is new, involves an inventive step and is
industrially applicable shall be patentable. It may be, or may relate to, a product, or process, or an improvement of any of the foregoing. (Sec. 7, R.A. No. 165a) 

## Non-Patentable Inventions.

The following shall be excluded from patent protection:

22.1. Discoveries, scientific theories and mathematical methods;

22.2. Schemes, rules and methods of performing mental acts, playing games
or doing business, and programs for computers;

22.3. Methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or
therapy and diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal
body. This provision shall not apply to products and composition for
use in any of these methods;

22.4. Plant varieties or animal breeds or essentially biological process for the
production of plants or animals. This provision shall not apply to microorganisms
and non-biological and microbiological processes. 
Provisions under this subsection shall not preclude Congress to
consider the enactment of a law providing sui generis protection of
plant varieties and animal breeds and a system of community
intellectual rights protection:

22.5. Aesthetic creations; and

22.6. Anything which is contrary to public order or morality. (Sec. 8, R.A. No. 165a)

## Novelty. 

An invention shall not be considered new if it forms
part of a prior art. (Sec. 9, R.A. No. 165a)

Prior Art. — Prior art shall consist of:

24.1. Everything which has been made available to the public anywhere in
the world, before the filing date or the priority date of the application
claiming the invention; and

24.2. The whole contents of an application for a patent, utility model, or
industrial design registration, published in accordance with this Act,
filed or effective in the Philippines, with a filing or priority date that is
earlier than the filing or priority date of the application: Provided, That
the application which has validly claimed the filing date of an earlier
application under Section 31 of this Act, shall be prior art with effect
as of the filing date of such earlier application: Provided further, That
the applicant or the inventor identified in both applications are not one
and the same. (Sec. 9, R.A. No. 165a) cdt 


## Right to a Patent. 

The right to a patent belongs to the
inventor, his heirs, or assigns. When two (2) or more persons have jointly
made an invention, the right to a patent shall belong to them jointly. (Sec.
10, R.A. No. 165a)


## First to File Rule. 

If two (2) or more persons have made the
invention separately and independently of each other, the right to the patent
shall belong to the person who filed an application for such invention, or
where two or more applications are filed for the same invention, to the
applicant who has the earliest filing date or, the earliest priority date. (3rd
sentence, Sec. 10, R.A. No. 165a.) 


## Inventions Created Pursuant to a Commission.

30.1. The person who commissions the work shall own the patent, unless otherwise provided in the contract.

30.2. In case the employee made the invention in the course of his employment contract, the patent shall belong to:

a. The employee, if the inventive activity is not a part of his regular
duties even if the employee uses the time, facilities and materials
of the employer.

b. The employer, if the invention is the result of the performance of
his regularly-assigned duties, unless there is an agreement,
express or implied, to the contrary. (n)

## Can I patent an iPhone app or other mobile app?
http://www.richardspatentlaw.com/faq/have-an-idea/can-i-patent-an-iphone-app/

Mobile apps, such as those sold in Apple's App Store for the iPhone and iPad and the Android Market for Android phones, are an increasingly profitable market.  With their rise in commercial success, mobile apps have increasingly been a hot topic for patent clients. Mobile apps are no different from other software when it comes to patent eligibility and patentability, which means yes, apps are patentable. However, there are nuances to explore when looking at whether it makes financial sense to pursue  a patent in a market in which a quick shelf life is the norm.

I have been working with mobile developers for years in helping them patent their apps. A common strategy is to file a provisional utility patent application around the launch date of the mobile app and use the one year that the provisional application is “patent pending” to assess whether the market reaction is favorable enough to pursue a non-provisional patent application when the deadline comes. This strategy enables you to minimize your upfront investment in the patent process, while maintaining your rights to pursue patent protection for your mobile app while you explore the market.

When working with mobile app developers, I am often able to prepare provisional patent applications for lower fees than a typical provisional application. This is because app developers often have very solid documentation of the invention (wireframes, screen shots, requirements docs., etc.) that helps to expedite the preparation of the provisional patent application. This can make the strategy of starting with a provisional patent application even more attractive.
